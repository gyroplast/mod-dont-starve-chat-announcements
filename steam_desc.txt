[h1]Chat Announcements[/h1]

Version 1.2.1, Workshop ID 2594707725

Announce (boss) monster and player deaths on a server and/or Discord. Highly configurable.

[h2]Features and Usage[/h2]

Have boss monster and player deaths announced as a server broadcast, and in a Discord server channel, optionally with a location (Overworld or Caves) and in-game time of death.
Player deaths are credited to most recent attacker within the last 5 seconds, even if dying by fire, cold, over-aging, etc.
No, PvP assists or "most damage dealt" is not implemented. Yet. :)

Setup a Discord Webhook once with [i]CASetDiscordURL("<URL>")[/i] in remote console on each shard (i. e. all running overworlds and caves), use [i]CATest()[/i] to test, [i]CAStatus()[/i] to view current settings.
